### Quantitative Finance bootcamp

Hello! I hope you're doing well. This is my bootcamp, where I try to revise my mathematical finance concepts such as derivatives-pricing, finite difference methods, solving the Black-Scholes PDE, etc. I do this in conjunction with brushing over my C++ skills, something that is in demand in the field of computational finance. I follow the book *C++ for Quantitative Finance* by Halls-Moore. 

### About me:
I'm a MS student at Stanford University, studying Computational and Mathematical Engineering within the [Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering](https://icme.stanford.edu/). My concentration is __Mathematical and Computational Finance__. I've already taken several classes on C++ (CME 211 + 212), Quantitative Finance (MATH 238, STATS 240, MS&E 448) and some statistics (CME 308, STATS 240).

CME 211 - *Scientific Computing for Scientists and Engineers* (teaches Python and C++)
CME 212 - *Software Development in C++*
MATH 238 - *Mathematical Finance*
STATS 240 - *Statistical Methods in Finance*
MS&E 448 - *Big Financial Data and Algorithmic Trading*
CME 308 - *Stochastic Methods in Engineering*
